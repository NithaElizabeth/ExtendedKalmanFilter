# Extended Kalman filter algorithm for mobile robot localization
With the growing stipulation for robot localization,the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm has received copious attention. 
The EKF algorithm is more realistic in non-linear systems as most systems are non-linear in the field of autonomous engineering, which has an autonomous white noise in both the system and the estimation model.
